# hons-proj-public
My undergraduate honours project, with other researchers' private code/information removed.

The project's goal is to infer the parameters of complex generative models, when doing so analytically is impractical and/or impossible.
which uses Bayesian optimization and Gaussian process regression to calculate an approximate posterior distribution over parameter settings.

For a full overview of the project, see my paper.

Note that this is a cloned version of the full repository - commit history and other git information is not available here.
